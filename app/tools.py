"""Tool functions over the static venue dataset (app.data).

Each public function returns a compact, JSON-serializable dict and never
raises on bad input: unknown venues and invalid enum values produce friendly
error payloads or graceful fallbacks. ``execute_tool`` is the dispatcher used
by both the Gemini function-calling loop and the offline engine.

Results are always freshly built dicts — the shared, lru_cached dataset
returned by ``app.data`` is never mutated. ``get_live_status`` is a SIMULATED
operations feed: deterministic pseudo-random output seeded by venue id and
hour, marked ``"simulated": true``. No network access.
